## YAML Fundamentals

YAML, which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language," is a human-readable data serialization format. It is commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between different programming languages and systems.

### Key Features:

1. **Human-readable**: YAML files are designed to be easily read and written by humans. Its syntax is simple and intuitive, using indentation to represent data structures.

2. **Expressive**: YAML supports a wide range of data types, including strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, and even nested data structures. This makes it versatile for representing complex data.

3. **Language-independent**: YAML is not tied to any particular programming language, making it a popular choice for configuration files and data exchange in multi-language environments.

### Example:

```yaml
# Example YAML document
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  hobbies:
    - Reading
    - Hiking
    - Cooking

```
### Use Cases:
**Configuration files:** YAML is commonly used for configuring applications and services due to its readability and flexibility.

**Data exchange:**  YAML is often used as a lightweight data interchange format between systems and programming languages.

### Difference: 
Here's a comparison between YAML, JSON, and XML:

1. **YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language):**
- Human-readable and easy to write
- Supports complex data structures with indentation.
- Less verbose compared to XML.
2. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
- Lightweight data interchange format.
- Widely supported in programming languages.
- Syntax similar to JavaScript objects.
3. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):**
- Designed to carry and store data.
- Hierarchical structure with tags.
- More verbose than YAML and JSON, but supports namespaces and validation.
